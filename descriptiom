The scoring system in the `calculate_personality_scores` function evaluates each Big Five personality trait based on the text and cluster characteristics of a resume. Hereâ€™s how each trait score is derived:

1. **Openness**: 
   - If the resume's cluster is `2`, Openness is set to `1.0` (high Openness), suggesting a creative or intellectual profile.
   - For other clusters, it is set to `0.5` (moderate Openness).

2. **Conscientiousness**: 
   - If the cluster is `0`, Conscientiousness is `1.0` (indicating strong traits like organization or responsibility).
   - If the cluster is `1`, Conscientiousness is `0.8` (high but slightly lower than `1.0`).
   - For all other clusters, it is set to `0.7`.

3. **Extraversion**: 
   - Extraversion is a combination of sentiment analysis and cluster data. `sentiment_score(text)` returns a positive score if the text has enthusiastic or energetic words, contributing to Extraversion.
   - For cluster `2`, an additional `0.7` is added to the sentiment score, highlighting a more extroverted profile.
   - For other clusters, `0.3` is added to the sentiment score, suggesting a lower baseline for Extraversion.

4. **Agreeableness**: 
   - If the cluster is `1`, Agreeableness is set to `0.9`, indicating strong cooperative or friendly traits.
   - For other clusters, it is `0.5` (average Agreeableness).

5. **Neuroticism**: 
   - Neuroticism combines two elements: sentiment and the count of stress-related keywords.
   - The base score is `0.7` for cluster `0`, `0.4` for cluster `1`, and `0.2` for other clusters, indicating a range of emotional stability.
   - The function adds `0.1` for each stress-related word in the text, up to a maximum increase of `1.0`, to reflect increased neurotic tendencies in resumes with high-stress word counts.

These scores are stored in the `ocean_df` DataFrame, giving each resume a profile across the Big Five traits based on both text content and cluster characteristics.
